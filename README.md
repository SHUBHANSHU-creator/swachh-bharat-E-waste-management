# swachh-bharat-E-waste-management
I used HTML,CSS for front end part and PHP and MySQL for the backend.  I have made a website to reduce E-waste which is very hazardous for our enviouronment.
I am giving all information you need to know about E-waste and how does it affects our enviouronment. The site tells some very good solutions to reduce
E-waste and also welcomes your opinions...How do you think E-waste can be managed. The main part of the site is that , this site helps you in donating 
the electronics you no longer use . The person who wants some electronic equipment can put their request and whenever it is available they will be contacted.
